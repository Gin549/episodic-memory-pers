**Step 4_4**<br />
-In this folder, there are two notebooks related to the variation of the VSLNet we decided to implement for this step. We chose variation 'a',
so we replaced the BERT text encoder with the GloVe text encoder
_As indicated by their names, one notebook contains the tests done with the Omnivore pre-extracted features, while the other one contains the tests with the EgoVLP pre-extracted features
