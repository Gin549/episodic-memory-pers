**Step 4_4_Extension**<br />
-In this folder, there are two notebook related to the proposed extension
-The Video_LLaVA Implementation notebook, contains the code that we used to obtain the textual answers, on the 50 best predictions of the NLQ task
-The Prediction Score Computing notebook contains the code that we used to compute the ROUGE, BERT, and METEOR scores for all the predictions we obtained. To run it, when you upload it to Colab, it is necessary to create a folder named "prediction" and upload at least one prediction file inside it. For testing, you can find the files in the folder "VideoLLAVA_Parameters_Test"
-The folder "VideoLLAVA_Parameters_Test" contains several tests we have done by changing the parameters of Video-LLaVA. Each file name represents the parameter we changed with respect to the default configuration and its new value
